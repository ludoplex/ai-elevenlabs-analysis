In the angles of the void
Whispers fracture time
Vertices bleed into shadow
I am lost in every line

Counting beats beneath my skin
Spiral patterns draw me in
Fractured heart in shifting frames
I chase echoes of your name
Tangled polyrhythmic plea
Breaking rules to set me free
Every measure bends and bends
Until the logic finally ends

Hear the pulse that never rests
Shadows dance inside my chest
Threads of reason start to fray
We dissolve and drift away
Unequal time becomes our cage

Call me ghost in broken rhyme
Carry me across the line
We collide in fractured glow
Lose control in numbers low
Edges bleed into the night
Find our truth in twisted light

Step through patterns unaligned
Whisper reason left behind
Dissect the silence in my mind
Gravity in every sign
Rituals fracture what we know
Into chaos we will go

Call me ghost in broken rhyme
Carry me across the line
We collide in fractured glow
Lose control in numbers low
Edges bleed into the night
Find our truth in twisted light

In the vertex of our minds
Shadows merge and redefine
And we vanish in the signs
